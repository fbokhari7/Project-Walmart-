This project aims to analyze the sales data of one of the largest retailers globally, focusing on understanding the factors influencing revenue. We will investigate whether variables such as air temperature, fuel cost, consumer price index (CPI), seasonal discounts, and the presence of holidays impact the sales performance of this major retail chain. By leveraging machine learning, we aim to identify key factors that contribute to revenue generation and explore how these insights can be used to minimize costs and maximize economic impact.

The dataset includes information from 45 Walmart stores, including weekly sales figures, air temperature, fuel prices, CPI, and unemployment rates in their respective regions. Our analysis will provide valuable insights into the retail industry's dynamics, offering strategies to enhance business performance and optimize decision-making processes.

## Problem Framing & Big Picture :

***
### 1. Problem and Objective Overview:
The problem at hand involves analyzing sales data to gain insights and forecast future sales. The objective is to understand the factors influencing sales and develop a model that can accurately predict future sales based on historical data. This analysis and forecasting can help optimize inventory management, staffing, and marketing strategies, leading to improved business performance.

### 2. Problem Framing:

The problem can be framed as a predictive modeling task, where the goal is to forecast future sales based on historical sales data and other relevant features. This involves building a machine learning model that can learn patterns from the historical data and use them to make predictions for future sales. The model should be able to handle both numerical and categorical features, as well as account for any seasonality or trends in the data.

### 3. Machine Learning Task:

**Regression Task:**

The machine learning task involves predicting a continuous value (weekly sales) based on input features. Regression is used because we are predicting a numerical outcome.

### 4. Performance Metrics:
We will use metrics like Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE), Mean Absolute Error (MAE), and R-squared (R²) to evaluate the performance of our regression models. RMSE measures the average prediction error, giving a higher weight to larger errors. MAE provides a more straightforward interpretation of the average magnitude of the errors. R² indicates the proportion of variance in the target variable explained by the model. Higher R² and lower RMSE and MAE values suggest better model performance.
